## Getting Started

Using bcgovr will help you to start a bcgov R package with all the necessary components.

The `create_bcgov_package()` function will create all the folders & files to get started on creating an R package. Type `?create_bcgov_package` in the R console for help. The [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) book by Hadley Wickham is a very useful resource if you are looking to create R packages.

You will need to supply the path to the folder where your new package is going to 
be to the `path` argument. The final element in the `path` will be the name of the 
package, so choose wisely. If you have already created the folder and are in that
working directory, you can leave `path = "."` (the default).

You should also supply your email address to the `coc_email` argument. This is the 
contact email should anyone feel that the Code of Conduct has been violated.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
create_bcgov_package(path = "C:/mynewrpackage", coc_email = "my.email@gov.bc.ca") 
```

## Using Version Control and GitHub

Once you have set up the package structure, you will probably want to set up Git 
and GitHub so you can share your package and invite contributors to work on it with
you. If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub see the [B.C. Policy Framework for GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Gov-Org-HowTo/Cheatsheet.md).

The easiest way to set this up is to use the `use_bcgov_git()` to set up Git for your project, then use the `use_bcgov_github()` function to upload it to GitHub.

Users can also use the *bcgovr Project & Package* templates in the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) New Project dialogue box to create a new R project or package. The dialogue box provides the option to select and individualise the required bcgov GitHub files and initialise Git version control.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/proj_template1.png") 
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/proj_template2.png") 
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/proj_template3.png") 
```

## pkgdown site

Once your package is ready for users, it is a good idea to create a [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) site to hold the documentation and vignettes.
