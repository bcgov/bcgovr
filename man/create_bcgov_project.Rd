\title{Create a bcgov R project directory structure}
\usage{
create_bcgov_project(path = ".", rmarkdown = TRUE, licence = "apache2",
  coc_email = get_coc_email(), dir_struct = getOption("bcgovr.dir.struct",
  default = NULL), open = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the directory in which to initialize the project.
Default \code{"."} - your current working directory.}

\item{rmarkdown}{Should an Rmarkdown file be added to the repository
with its corresponding markdown file? Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{licence}{Which licence to apply? Default is Apache 2.0 (\code{"apache2"}).
Use \code{"cc-by"} for \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/}{Creative Commons Attribution 4.0}}

\item{coc_email}{Contact email address(es) for the Code of Conduct. It is
recommended that you save this setting by adding a line like:
\code{options("bcgovr.coc.email" = "your.email@gov.bc.ca")} to yor \code{.Rprofile}.
Use \code{\link[usethis:edit_r_profile]{usethis::edit_r_profile()}} for an easy way to find and edit this file.}

\item{dir_struct}{Alternative project directory structure. This should be specified as
a character vector of directory (i.e. folders) and file paths, relative to the root of the project.
Directories should be identified by having a trailing forward-slash (e.g., \code{"dir/"}).

The default is: \code{c("R/", "data/", "out/", "01_load.R", "02_clean.R", "03_analysis.R", "04_output.R", "run_all.R")}.

This can also be set as an option \code{bcgovr.dir.struct}. You may want to set this in your
.Rprofile file so that every time you start a new project, your custom project structure is set up.
The line in your \code{.Rprofile} file would look something like this:
\code{options("bcgovr.dir.struct" = c("doc/", "data/", "results/", "src/01_load.R", "src/02_clean.R", "src/03_analysis.r", "src/04_output.R", "src/run_all.R"))}}

\item{open}{If TRUE and in RStudio, the new project is opened in a new instance,
if possible, or is switched to, otherwise.}
}
